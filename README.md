Solution? Invoke this shell wizard and it will:

- Ask you which apps that you'd like to install on your MacOS machine;
- Use brew/brew cask to install these apps and even GUI-based ones such as Slack, Chrome.

This automation tool can save you from wasting some several hours of configuration!

## Running the setup Wizard

Clone this repo and run `wizard.sh` with bash:

`bash wizard.sh`

Then, just answer the questions and install the software that you'd like to have!
